# Editing Exercise 

Edit each of the following WAV files \(source-files.zip in Oncourse/ Week 5/ Edit Exercise\) to meet the following specifications\:  
**•	outdoors-shotgun.wav\:** remove all traces of handling noise—only the natural sounds should remain as one continuous sound that is 27-30 seconds long.  
**•	store.wav\:** remove all of the beeps and clangs, so you are left with 3-5 seconds of continuous convenience store ambiance.  
**•	metal-drop.wav\:** edit three of the best metallic impact sounds from these five recordings. Try to retain the metallic ringing after each initial impact.  
**•	squeaks.wav\:** edit three squeaks that would be best when designing for the sound of a small cart with squeaky wheels.  
**•	coins.wav\:** edit three-coin spilling sounds with the most shimmery, metallic quality.  
When finished, add comments to each track, and assign a unique track and region color. Save your session, zip it, and post it to Oncourse/ Week 5/ Edit Exercise.
