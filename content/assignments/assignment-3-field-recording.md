# Assignment 3\: Zoom \(Field\) SFX Recording

Using the the Zoom H4n, you will make five recordings with the following parameters\:

- Ambience beds
  - LARGE environment; 2-3 minutes
  - SMALL environment; 2-3 minutes
- Ambience details
  - LARGE object/device/event; 1-2 minutes
  - MEDIUM object/device/event; 1-2 minutes
  - SMALL object/device/event; 1-2 minutes

For the environmental recordings, capture 2-3 minutes of sound. There will inevitably be interruptions and disturbances but these will be edited out later on in Assignment 4.

## Variations

When making the object/event/device recordings, evoke as much sound as you can in the span of 1-2 minutes. Think of these parameters when trying to get good variations:

- **Duration**: Perform the event with short and long takes. Keep in mind that long takes can easily be shortened. Short takes, however, don’t give you much to work with. Record a variety to provide flexibility during editing.
- **Frequency**: Recordings can be varied by how frequently events are performed. Changing the timing between events will make the takes different and give you more to work with later.
- **Impact**: How hard or soft you perform an action can evoke emotion (for example, slamming a door) or can imply weight (a hard body fall on wood). When recording, try to vary the force with which you move or strike objects.
- **Perspective**: Where you place the microphone can give you different perspectives on a sound. Try miking footsteps from underneath stairs, a garage door from the inside and the outside, or even door knocks from both sides of a door. Using different perspectives gives you not only different sounds but also source material to use for mixing and designing different effects.
- **Speed**: The speed of an object will affect how it sounds. Recording a car driving by at the same speed five times is only going to give you five takes of one sound. Try recording the car driving by going 15 mph, 35 mph, 55 mph, 75 mph, and 95 mph. This will give you five different sound effects. You can apply the same principle of variation to other sounds (opening and closing doors, typing on a keyboard, fan speeds, and so on).

## Slate recordings

Each sound recording should be accompanied with a slated voice indicating:

- Name of object or location being recorded Specific object or location information Activity being performed
- Here are some examples of slates:
  - “Door knock, hollow wood door using the open palm of my hand” “Door knock, hard wood door using a closed fist”
  - “Car drive-by, Pontiac 2007 Grand Am at 45 mph”
  - “Forest, with a stream nearby”
  - “Insects, forest ambience”

Turn in a Reaper project with 5 tracks for each recording you make. This way you will be ready to edit the files in the next project.
