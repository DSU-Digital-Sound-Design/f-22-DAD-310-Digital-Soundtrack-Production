# Assignment 3\: Zoom \(Field\) SFX Recording

- Using the the Zoom H4n, you will make five recordings with the following parameters\:
- LARGE environment; stereo recording; 2-3 minutes
- SMALL environment; stereo recording; 2-3 minutes
- LARGE object/device/event; mono recording; 1-2 minutes
- MEDIUM object/device/event; mono recording; 1-2 minutes
- SMALL object/device/event; mono recording; 1-2 minutes

For the environmental recordings, capture 2-3 minutes of sound. There will inevitably be interruptions and disturbances but these will be edited out later on in Assignment 4. When making the object/event/device recordings, evoke as much sound as you can in the span of 1-2 minutes. For example, if youâ€™re recording the sound of unlocking and opening a door, first go through this process gently, then be forceful. Unlock and open the door at different paces, and so on. You never know what will work best for a final sound effect, so give yourself lots of variations to work with in future assignments.

Of the five recordings, two \(or more\) are required to draw on ideas from the "Sound Effects Encyclopedia" \(p. 209-309\) in Ric Viers' **[Sound Effects Bible](http://www.ricviers.com/sfx/)**. The others you create can be original ideas for objects, events, and environments that suit your tastes and current production projects.

On the due date you will turn in a zipped \(compressed as a .zip archive\) Pro Tools session folder with all of your recordings labeled and notated on separate tracks. See the note at the bottom on how to annotate your Pro Tools sessions for these assignments.
