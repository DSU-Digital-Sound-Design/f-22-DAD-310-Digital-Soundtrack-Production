# Assignment 4: SFX Editing

## Part 1 - Editing

Using the five recordings made in Assignment 3, edit each to meet the following requirements\:

- LARGE and SMALL environments\: remove all unwanted or unintended sounds and edit down to 1 minute so that the sound of each environment is continuous and has no interruptions.
- LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event\: edit so that there are five versions or variations of each.

This means you'll have 17 sound effects. Two environments and 5 variations of the three different types of object/device/event.

Your editing on this assignment will focus on L-I-T-E of Viersâ€™ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra \(p. 187\). The idea is to pare down your longer recordings so that you can later focus on the most usable sections.

## Part 2 - Processing

Finalize each sound to meet the following requirements\:

- LARGE and SMALL environments\: Normalize in the range -16 to -12 dB and apply equalization or other effects as needed for these to sound as natural and realistic as possible.
- LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event\: Normalize to -0.5 dB and apply equalization, light compression, and other effects to achieve your desired results.
- Bounce all five of your final sound effects \(two stereo environments; three mono objects/devices/events\).

Turn in your project file along with rendered files for each sound effect.
