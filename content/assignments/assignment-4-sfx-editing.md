# Assignment 4: SFX Editing

Using the five recordings made in Assignment 3, edit each to meet the following requirements\:

- LARGE and SMALL environments\: remove all unwanted or unintended sounds and edit down to 1 minute so that the sound of each environment is continuous and has no interruptions.
- LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event\: edit so that there are five versions or variations of each.

This means you'll have 17 sound effects. Two environments and 5 variations of the three different types of object/device/event.

Your editing on this assignment will focus on L-I-T-E of Viersâ€™ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra \(p. 187\). The idea is to pare down your longer recordings so that you can later focus on the most usable sections.

Turn in your project file along with rendered files for each sound effect.
