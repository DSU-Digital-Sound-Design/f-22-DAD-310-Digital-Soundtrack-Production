# Assignment 4: SFX Editing


Using the five recordings made in Assignment 3, edit each to meet the following requirements\:  
- 	LARGE and SMALL environments\: remove all unwanted or unintended sounds and edit down to 1 minute so that the sound of each environment is continuous and has no interruptions.  
- 	LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event\: edit so that there are five versions or variations of each  

Your editing on this assignment will focus on L-I-T-E of Viersâ€™ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra \(p. 187\). The idea is to pare down your longer recordings so that you can later focus on the most usable sections.  

On the due date, you will turn in a zipped \(compressed as a .zip archive\) Pro Tools session folder with all of your edits labeled and notated on separate tracks. See the note at the bottom on how to annotate your Pro Tools sessions for these assignments.
