# Assignment 7: Ambiences

Sound designers are frequently called on to create the sound of real and imaginary places where the events of a story or game take place. Real-world sites can be straightforward: visit the location, record, edit, process as needed, and add to your production. This is not always the case, however. Often the recording of an actual place does not sound right, given how the location is portrayed after editing a scene together. Imaginary locations (“fantastic,” “futuristic,” and so on) that do not exist are a blank canvas. Elements of these worlds can be rooted in our conception of reality. Still, the actual sound is ultimately determined by the collective vision and work of directors, designers, and those who create the sound. This assignment presents these challenges to you.

Using the recording, editing, and synthesis techniques we have discussed, create one 30-second ambience \: one of a real-world location OR one of an imaginary place.  
Take the following steps\:

1. Find an image that provides a visual reference for the location you have in mind \(see examples above\).
2. Make a sound map that lists all possible elements that would create the sound of this place. Based on your image, what’s needed to create the sound of this place? Consider what you see, but also consider those elements that you suspect would be nearby and audible within the frame of your chosen image.
3. Record \(and if helpful, synthesize\) the elements you need to develop the sound of the location.
4. Use Viers’ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra to prepare your recordings. Follow the techniques presented in class to mix the environment and put everything together in Pro Tools. Your final session should sound like a continuous recording of the place depicted in your chosen image.
5. Put the following items into a folder\:
   - Pro Tools session
   - Final, 30-second stereo WAV or AIFF file. Name it based on the environment you intended to create, such as ancient-mars.wav or downtown-street-corner.aif.
   - Soundmap with details for your chosen location
   - Image that guided your work
6. Zip this folder and post to Oncourse/ A7 Eigentone and Ambience.
