title: "Final Project"

Create a sound design that is around six minutes. This can be of an animated short that you made. Or of a feature film. If you do a feature, select three contrasting scenes to create the sound design for.

Each successful sound design will contain dialogue, foley, and ambience.

## Foley

Record as much live foley as possible. Remember that foley is used to represent a character, so every action a character takes can be recorded as foley. Sounds that can't be recorded in the studio should be recorded with a portable zoom recorder. Remember to organize your foley into three types:

- moves or cloth;
- footsteps
- specifics, spots or props

## Ambiences

Ambiences can come in the form of indoor or outdoor. Create convincing ambiences for whatever scene you have to work with. If the scene is indoors you will use room tone as an ambience. If it is outdoors your ambience will contain the sounds we spoke of in the early weeks; sounds of the earth, humans, and sounds of non-human life. The ambience tracks can be further broken down into beds and details.

- **Beds** - continuous layers of sound, providing a foundation for the rest of the sounds within a scene
- **Details** - can be used as fleeting elements to punctuate the soundscape at particular moments.

Organize your project to clearly show the three catagories of the sound track. I should be able to easily tell what was foley, dialogue or ambience.

## Misc SFX

There will be sound effects that don't fall into the above catagories. Examples of these have been shown in the last week of class: explosions, sci-fi weapons, etc. Anything that is seen on screen that isn't a character or an ambience falls into this category. Often these sounds are made up of many layers and take time to create to sound realistic.

Your sound effects needs will vary depending on the needs of the project.

## Final Mix

The final mix might be the most important part of the whole project. Here you balance all of your elements with each other, then against he other elements. You also add automation to make sure that the changes between scenes have the emotional weight they need.

First mix the dialogue. If you are working on a project that already has dialogue you won't have to do much. The dialogue together should sit at around -12 db to -6 dB. Compressors can be useful to keep the dialogue within the desired range of dynamics.

Then bring in the foley, the other sound effects, and final the ambiences.

Remember also that all of your sounds may have been recorded in different locations. Use reverb as a SEND to put your sounds in similar places.

Also, use panning and panning automation to make sounds follow events on the screen spatially.
