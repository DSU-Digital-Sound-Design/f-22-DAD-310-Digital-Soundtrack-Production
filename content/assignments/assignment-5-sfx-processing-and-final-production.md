title: "Assignment 5"

Using your edited sounds from Assignment 4, finalize each to meet the following requirements\:  
-	LARGE and SMALL environments\: Normalize in the range -16 to -12 dB and apply equalization or other effects as needed for these to sound as natural and realistic as possible.  
-	LARGE, MEDIUM, and SMALL object/device/event\: Normalize to -0.5 dB and apply equalization, light compression, and other effects to achieve your desired results.  
-	Bounce all five of your final sound effects \(two stereo environments; three mono objects/devices/events\) to disk and put them in a FINAL-SFX folder within your Pro Tools session folder.  

Your work on this assignment will focus primarily on S-N of Viersâ€™ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra \(p. 187\), though the other steps are still relevant depending on the signal processing your sound requires. This final step will yield five complete, production-ready sound effects.  

On the due date, you will turn in a zipped \(compressed as a .zip archive\) Pro Tools session folder with all of your edits labeled and notated on separate tracks. See the note at the bottom on how to annotate your Pro Tools sessions for these assignments.
