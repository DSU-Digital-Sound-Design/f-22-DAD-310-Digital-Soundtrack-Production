# Assignment 6\: Sound Synthesis  

Forbidden Planet \(1956\) was the first film to feature an entirely electronic musical score. Sonic pioneers **[Louis and Bebe Barron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_and_Louis_Barron)** were initially hired to create sound effects for the movie. After hearing their work, the film’s producers retained the Barons for the entire soundtrack. Their other-worldly compositions took audiences to a place they had never been, raising the bar for what was now possible in the realm of sound for film and other visual media. **[Read more \>\>\>](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bebe-barron-cocomposer-of-the-first-electronic-film-score-for-forbidden-planet-822755.html)**

Using any of the synthesis tools we have discussed \(or others with which you are familiar\), you will create five foreground sounds for a science fiction scene. Take the following steps\:  
1.	Find an image from a science fiction film, book, or game \(examples below\).  
2.	Make a sound map that lists all possible foreground sounds. Don’t think about ambiances, environmental sounds, or eigentones—we’ll get to those in Assignment 7. For now, identify those elements with a primary or secondary focus. Based on your image, what’s needed? What are the sounds implied? List everything on your sound map and choose five from your list.  
3.	Use Vital Synth to create your five sounds. You may use presets if you wish or make your sounds.  
4.	Follow Viers’ L-I-S-T-E-N Editing Mantra to edit and process as needed.  
5.	Put the following items into a folder\:  
	* 	Five finished sound effects \(mono or stereo WAV or AIFF files\)  
	* 	Reaper project file 
	* 	Soundmap  
	* 	Sci-fi image  
6.	Zip this folder and post it to D2L.
