# Assignment 2: Studio Foley Recording

Download the video [here](../HardSurface_robot_animation-346689615.mp4)

Working with your same team of three from Assignment 1, you will use Reaper (or another DAW) to record and layer Foley sound effects for the animation.

What sound sources do you use this time around? Think about the strengths and weaknesses of your previous Foley work. You will have complete control over how these sounds are captured \(recorded\), making it easier to work with objects that are very quiet or too temperamental for a live performance. In addition, working with your group of three, you will be able to build up many layers of sound and adjust the levels so that every element is balanced to match the on-screen animation.

As before, you may organize your recording and sounds in any way you see fit. It is still helpful to think of the robot in three parts\: feet & legs, torso & head, arms & fingers. However, you will be able to record each body part separately, so there are many different ways to put your final Foley design together\: just the feet, just the eyes, just the fingers, etc. Discuss with your group and choose the approach that best suits your available time and props.

Remember that animation means "bring to life." Reflect on the sounds that will lead your audience to believe this robot is moving and dancing autonomously. Groups should pay close attention to the synchronization and final balance of all sounds in their work.

Project requirements\:

-     The animation is 10 seconds long; all objects and events that make a sound must be represented somehow.
- All sound-making objects are fair game for this assignment, but you can not use anything explosive or otherwise dangerous.
- Evaluations will be based on the efforts of your entire group. This includes the sound quality of your recordings, synchronization, and overall mix/balance of the final Foley design.
-     Your group should zip \(compress as a zip archive\) your **entire** DAW session \(including all audio and video files\) and post to D2l on or before the assignment due date.
