## Setting: Ambience, Immersion And Sense Of Place

Setting = when and where

Sound is a major part of this setting of place in a film.

## Ambience

- **Beds** - continuous layers of sound, providing a foundation for the rest of the sounds within a scene
- **Details** - can be used as fleeting elements to punctuate the soundscape at particular moments.

{{% note %}}
These layers of sounds we usually ignore but would miss if they were gone.

We can go back to the first chapter and talk about ambience in 3 different catagories:

> Does anyone remember what those were?

- Schafer
  - Sounds of the Earth (for example, whistling wind, creaking glaciers, rumbling volcanoes). - **geophony**
  - Sounds of non-human life (for example, chirping insects, warbling birdsong, howling wolves). - **biophony**
  - Sounds of humanity (for example, clanging industry, babbling voices, beeping machines). - **anthrophony**

### Beds - Wuthering Heights (2011)

{{% note %}}
In the 2011 version of Wuthering Heights, the natural elements are used in place of a score, giving the film a bleak but evocatively evolving tone. As director Andrea Arnold recalled, ‘When I was up on the moors I felt the wind was like music.’

### Details - The Elephant Man

This technique is seen at work in The Elephant Man’s iconic train-station scene, in which the protagonist’s escalating situation is underscored by the sounds of off-screen trains that increase in tempo and intensity, creating a dramatic emotional trajectory.

## Room Tones

> the ‘dead air’ of an indoor space, the sound that remains when there is no action.

- Bathroom - <audio src="room-tone/room tone bathroom windy vent.wav" controls>
- Hallway - <audio src="room-tone/room tone hallway heavy ventilation and electrical machinery.wav" controls>
- Large library - <audio src="room-tone/room tone large room library.wav" controls>
- Stairway - <audio src="room-tone/room tone stairway 1.wav" controls>

We can color the room tone using EQ. With a greater balance of higher frequencies, a cooler, more clinical effect can be created. EQ also has a more straightforward application in taming room tone recordings – you will often need to cut the very highest and lowest frequencies to avoid excess hiss and rumble.

We can pitch shift our room tones to add character. By duplicating a layer that contains a single frequency tone, and applying a pitch shift effect, we can create harmonies that carry a particular emotion. A major third (four semitones), or a perfect fifth (seven semitones), creates a more positive feeling, whereas a minor third (three semitones) evokes sadness. A diminished fifth (six semitones), or a single semitone, creates a clashing sense of dissonance, which is useful in horror.

### Eraserhead

{{% note %}}
We can also create tones using sustained music notes, pitched up or down to blend with the other layers. If our chosen sound works with the image and has the right atmosphere for the scene, we need not worry about motivating it in terms of a source within the room. In fact, many films make no attempt at realism within the room tones. This is the case with many horror and science-fiction films, or in the crackling and rumbling domestic spaces of Eraserhead, for example.

### Setting and Character

Domestic Spaces

- clocks;
- dripping taps;
- gushing pipes;
- washing machines;
- dishwashers;
- fridges;
- extractor fans;
- air conditioners;

---

- boilers;
- heaters;
- buzzing lights;
- TV and radio;
- insects;
- rodents.

a sound designer can reflect the inner life of a subject through the sounds of their home. What kind of objects and technology have they chosen to fill their rooms with? Which radio station do they listen to, what TV do they watch? Does their space seem cold and reflective, or do soft furnishings and absorbent walls create a warmer feel? Whilst our work always plays off the picture to some extent, there is much opportunity for imagining off-screen elements, and for taking creative licence with what we see.

Should the outside world break into the room with the character or not?

We can also hear this idea at work in Barton Fink, where the eponymous character, stuck in the hell of writer’s block, is haunted by a mosquito. Each time the door of his hotel room closes, we get the sense of air being sucked out of the room, leaving him in the creative vacuum, alone with his flying foe.

### Sense of Place

- [100 Soundscapes of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Soundscapes_of_Japan)
- [Museum of Endangered Sounds](http://savethesounds.info/)
- [Soundmark](https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Soundmark.html)

{{% note %}}
In 1996, the Japanese government designated ‘100 Soundscapes of Japan’, in an effort to protect certain well-loved acoustic environments against the threat of noise pollution. The chosen sounds, such as the ship whistles at Yokohama Port, insects singing in Oshikiri and the squeaking sand of Kotogahama Beach, bring a unique character to their location, just as the chimes of Big Ben serve as a shorthand for London.

### Setting as Character

in High- Rise, the eponymous building serves as the main character, dominating the lives of its inhabitants, ‘like a huge and aggressive malefactor...determined to inflict every conceivable hostility upon them’. Martin Pavey’s hyperreal, industrial sound design, often set against a rousing classical score, suggests a suitably maniacal presence.

### Extending the Frame

{{% note %}}
To give a sense of surroundings, a scene is often established using long shots, before the camera goes in closer. Designers tend to match this progression in the ambience – beginning with a wider context, before narrowing down as we focus in on the action. The camera perspective usually continues to jump around, but we do not always adjust the scale and angle of the atmos to match, especially during dialogue scenes.

### Son of Saul

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZMuLU94HTc?start=4125" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
Son of Saul tells a story of humanity within the hell of Auschwitz through tight framings that largely focus on the protagonist’s face, obscuring much of the visual context. The scale and horror of the Holocaust setting is instead expressed through Tamás Zányi’s haunting soundscapes, which convey the industrial nature of the camp’s daily atrocities. The relentless cycles of murder are given an even greater sense of dread by being heard but not seen, simultaneously immersing and disconnecting the audience through an ‘acoustic counterpoint to the intentionally narrowed imagery’. This effect powerfully reflects the way that those at the heart of day-to- day trauma must blind themselves to it, in order to function.

### Hunger

{{% note %}}
Hunger takes a different approach to extension, with a soundscape that barely expands the frame. Telling the story of Bobby Sands’ fatal hunger strike in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland, designer Paul Davies avoids the typical background of off- screen shouts and cell-door slams, instead focusing on the claustrophobia of the cell itself. This works to bring us into the character’s singular, extremely determined perspective, as we come to terms with the profound price he is willing to pay.

### Rear Window

{{% note %}}
These are examples of highly subjective narratives, taking place in extreme environments and employing suitably bold modes of conveying setting. Most films demonstrate a mix of approaches, with the level of extension being varied to suit each moment. Michel Chion describes this effect in Rear Window, a film in which the action is entirely viewed from an apartment overlooking a courtyard. It is a visual approach that is contrasted by a dynamic use of ambiences. According to Chion, ‘Sometimes it lets us hear the big city thrumming outside this courtyard that the film never leaves. At other times the sound track eliminates the larger cityscape entirely, so as to reconcentrate the spectator on the apartment itself...At the very end of the film, the extension becomes extremely narrow, focusing on a single point, like a lone spotlight pursuing a character on a stage.’
