Your assignment for today is to spot and add sound effects for all of the footsteps in this animation. Pick footsteps sounds that you think match the character and make sure there is enough variation to not become boring. Also add sounds to match the character getting sucked into the bag at the end.

Get sound effects from freesound.org.

## Spotting

Add empty MIDI clips to the exact place where you want to spot. You can inert a MIDI clip by pressing command (control) + drag. To rename these clips open the Project Bay -> Media Items tab. Rename your items here. Select options -> "Mirror selection in bay and project", and "Zoom/scroll to selected media items when mirroring selection". The project bay makes it easy to move between items in your project.

## Adding sound effects

We can get a recording of someone walking from freesound and split it up using dynamic split. After you split the items hwo you want render them as separate files then find them in teh media explorer.

Now you can drag a single footstep file from the Media Explorer onto one of your empty spot MIDI tracks. Select "Replace target media with source media". Option drag if necessary to make the start of the media item correct

Editing items - change playback rate not preserving pitch with option + drag. Try different stretch settings to obtain better results.

Turn in what you have made by the end of the day.
