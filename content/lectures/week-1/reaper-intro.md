The following tutorial is based on this video: [This is REAPER 6 - Intro (1/15)](https://youtu.be/bepxGZ-ZXGE)

# Intro

One of the most unique features of Reaper compared to other DAWs such as Pro Tools, Logic, or Ableton is that everything is customizable. This includes key commands, menus, toolbars, and mouse behaviors. it has pretty good defaults, so you don't have to worry about customizing everything right away.

We can hide the mixer by closing it (cmd+M).

# Tracks

Create new tracks by double-clicking in the track pane. Delete extra tracks by selecting the track and hitting delete on your computer keyboard.

There are no track types in Reaper. Tracks can include audio, MIDI or video items, or even multiples on the same track.

Tracks can also become folders containing many tracks.

# Timeline

Now see the Timeline / Ruler. We can set the division to Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds, timecode, or samples. Take a second and switch your timeline to each of those options.

Find a few random sounds from freesound.org and import them. Notice how the track name changes to match the item name. As you drag in clips notice how the items snap to the grid. If this doesn't happen make sure you have snapping turned on.

# Items

I Reaper we refer to audio files as Items or Media Items. These can be copy pasted and moved to taste. We can also trim the beginning and ending of the tracks with our mouse cursor. We can also trim multiple files at once by selecting them all.

Dragging an item to the right will cause it to start looping.

We can add fade-in and fade-outs by holding our cursor over the top corner of the items. We can also apply fades to all tracks by selecting them.

Zoom in and out of items vertically using your mouse wheel. Zoom horizontally using the modifier cmd and your mouse wheel.

Right click the items to see a contextual menu with more options for the items.

# Track control panel

The TCP gives access to the volume, mute, solo, pan and other parameters of each track.

Right click the tracks to get a contextual menu with more options for each track. You can right click on pretty much anything to get a contextual menu with more options.

# Mixer

Now open back up the mixer pane. See that the same controls are available here as from the TCP. The mixer view makes it easier to mix our tracks together. The mixer window can be rearranged to another part of the screen or floated.

# Tempo

The bpm of the project can be changed from the tempo menu on the bottom right of the screen (the transport). If we want to play back slower while also adjusting pitch we cna do that with the rate knob.

# Track views

Adjust the track heights or widths with your mouse.

# Transport

The transport can be hidden if you need more room for your tracks.

# Themes

Change the way Reaper looks with themes

# Actions

Control pretty much anything in Reaper with Actions. View the actions menu (shift + ?)
