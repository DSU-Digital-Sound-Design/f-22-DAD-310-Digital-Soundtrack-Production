title: "Recording Foley"
---

Captured with mono microphone, two to 3 feet away from source giving a natural sound.

Recording at too close a distance will cause "proximity effect" adding bass onto the signal.

Typically we'll use a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern. Try large diaphragm and small diaphragm to hear which one works better for your source.

Our small diaphragm microphones include:

- AT 4041
- Slate Digital Ml2
- ST31 FET
- Carvin CM90e
- MXL 990

> Tell me about each of the different mic types listed and what they're good for.
