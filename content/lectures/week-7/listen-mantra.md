# The Editing Mantra L-I-S-T-E-N

- L - Listen Critically
- I - Identify Clicks, Pops, and Errors
- S - Signal Process (EQ and Compression)
- T - Trim/Crop the File
- E - Examine Fade-Ins/Fade-Outs at the Zero Line
- N - Normalize/Name File

## Listen Critically

Start by listening to the file for sonic integrity. Ask the simple question
“does this sound good?” “Is this sound useful or practical?” If the answer is ‘no’, then do not use the sound.

## Identify Clicks, Pops, and Errors

If there are noticeable clicks, pops, or errors, edit the waveform to correct them. Every sound must be free of these imperfections.

## Signal Process (EQ and Compression)

Apply equalization to balance the sound. Generally, subtractive equalization is used to reduce unwanted background noise or intrusive frequencies. Additive equalization is used to boost or enhance frequencies that are lacking or to give a particular effect (for example, bass rumble). Light compression should be used to keep the sound balanced in terms of amplitude.

## Trim/Crop the File

Each file should start immediately and end when the sound is finished. Use
a trim/crop function to automatically perform this operation, or fade the file in and out manually.

## Examine Fade-Ins/Fade-Outs at the Zero Line

After trimming/cropping or fading the file, examine the very first sample at the start and end of each file. This will allow you to identify clicks and pops that can occur when the file starts or ends above or below the zero line. Fade the offending samples to the zero line to correct this.

## Normalize/Name File

Normalize the audio to -.5dB. You don’t need to normalize ambiences or sound beds; peak points anywhere from -18dB to -6dB are acceptable for these types of sounds. Finally, name the sound as descriptively as possible and embed the file with metadata using expressive keywords.
