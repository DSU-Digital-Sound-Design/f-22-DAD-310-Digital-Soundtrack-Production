Based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdktuXuYkjg).

An explosion is a complex sound that fills up multiple frequency ranges. Because of this we need to use layering to create our complex explosion sound. Layering involves overlapping sound effects on many tracks to build up the desired result. We can also group together similar tracks for processing.

In addition to layering we will use pitch shifting, stretching, and reversing to achieve our desired effect.

> We're going to remake the explosion in this [scene](https://youtu.be/GV8fDIGBtxM?t=17).

An explosion is likely to have the following basic layers or parts. Make these as tracks to organize your sub layers.

- rumble
- punch
- fire
- roar
- hiss
- debris

Of course this list depends on the size of the explosion, what is exploding, and what sort of structure might be destroyed by the explosion. An explosion in a movie is also complicated by the fact that directors usually show it from multiple angles and take up more time than the explosion usually would have for dramatic effect. These explosions are very theatrical.

## Rumble

I have added three different layers of rumble. Each one for a slightly different tonal color.
