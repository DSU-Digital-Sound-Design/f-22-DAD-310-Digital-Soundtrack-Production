title: "Tron Sound Design"

This sound design is influenced by this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R3F07mfx14), thought we are using a different clip and source sounds.

The most important part of this process is searching for sounds. Finding the right sounds will mean less editing and manipulation later, and also a more believable sound for the audience. The Matt from the tutorial provides a few helpful search terms to find sounds that are related to the feel of the scene.

The first word is _energy_. I'm also looking for sounds that have an electricity to them. Other words that might work: drone, hum etc.

I also searched _Lom_ which is a maker of interesting microphones that can be used to record electrical signals. I then spent quite a while just looking for interesting sounds before starting to edit them.

> Hint: When working with many items it is a good idea to be able to solo and unsolo the items themselves instead of having to reach over to the tracks. You can set up a keyboard shortcut for this.
