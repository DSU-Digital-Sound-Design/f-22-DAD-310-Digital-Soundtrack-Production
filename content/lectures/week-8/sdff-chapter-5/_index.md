## Sound Worlds And Metaphors

{{% note %}}
We'll now go deeper into what sounds mean, how they can either deliver information directly or indirectly. Sound can refer directly, or metaphorically using one thing to refer to another.

But why use metaphor at all?

> A film only exists when it’s reflected in someone’s heart. That’s why I often sit in a cinema and watch some mindless thing on the screen and see people stare at it just as mindlessly, and I realize: this film does not even exist. It provokes no repercussions, no encounters.

> It’s a waste, not only of time. But if a film leaves the space for the spectator to dream himself or herself into it, to read ‘between the lines,’ to fill it with his or her own experiences and thereby make it come to life, then and only then it exists.

This view suggests that the true stuff of cinema is the interaction between image, sound and audience. A film comes into being only when it is experienced. If the material does not respect those to whom it will play, spoon-feeding meaning with no gaps or intrigue, boredom is the likely result. But if room is allowed for multiple interpretations, a work’s meaning becomes richer, expanding within the imagination of the audience.

Eraserhead and Elephant Man takes this metaphorical sound concept to extremes through in the collaborations of director David Lynch and sound designer Alan Splet.

These works contain a high degree of ambiguity, with much left open to interpretation. Certain metaphors are repeating themes – industrial images and sounds form symbolic threads, commonly interpreted along the lines of dreams and the unconscious mind. The machines can be heard as rhymes for the mechanics of the brain, with the recordings often pitched down, giving them a strange, otherworldly feel and transporting us to places that defy straightforward readings. In this way, cinematic symbols can be used to explore mysterious regions whose truths cannot be articulated in more literal terms.

## Sound Worlds

- [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/watch/2fd691a0-f66b-467f-8635-00d7f151f3d4)
  - poor families home - start - 6:00
  - Rich people's home - 12:36 - onwards

For social satire Parasite, designer Ralph Tae-Young Choi was tasked with developing distinctive aesthetics for the spaces of two families – one rich, the other poor. The hard-up family’s home is subjected to a constant stream of sounds – aggressive dogs, passing cars and noisy neighbours – breaking in from the outside. By contrast, only birdsong and a gentle breeze flow into the wealthy household, while the interior sounds are given lavish, immersive reverb, lending a sense of scale and openness. The doors and gates of the property were also given particular attention in the design, acting as a source of ‘metaphorical sound representing the difference between the haves and have-nots’.

This kind of approach makes use of **sound worlds** – sets of audible qualities that mark out the different territories of a story. Just as a production designer might use colour themes to represent the essence of a character, a sound designer can evoke the underlying nature of things with sound.

- Sound worlds can be
  - the domain of a **character, group, time or place** (wealthy elite, future, hell);
  - a **story theme** (social structure, technology, religion);
  - a side of a **narrative conflict** (rich vs poor, reality vs fantasy, life
    vs death).
- Created with aesthetic qualities of sound
  - pitch (low, high), rhythm (regular, irregular), timbre (bassy, bright), style (realist, hyperrealist, surrealist).

Once the worlds have been populated with sonic features, we need to think about how we will apply them. Our chosen qualities of sound might relate to voice, foley and atmos, or perhaps reveal themselves in non-diegetic elements, representing the sound world acousmatically.
