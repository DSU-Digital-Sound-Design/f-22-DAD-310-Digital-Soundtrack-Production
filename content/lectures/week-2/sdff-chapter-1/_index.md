This is a version of experimental composer John Cage's 4'33'' in which the musicians are instructed not to play their instruments for the duration of the performance. The sound of the piece is whatever is audible in the space during those four minutes and thirty-three seconds.

The piece becomes the acoustic environment of the duration of the performance. We can also describe this as a soundscape.

**What acoustic environment came out of this performance?**

Work's like this promote a different type of listening that is beneficial to develop your ear for creating sound design for film.

Pauline Oliveros describes this kind of meditation as deep listening – a reflective practice that works towards an intuitive and profound understanding of sound.

# Listing Activity A

Immerse yourself in the soundscape of your present experience. Close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you, wherever you happen to be at the moment. Focus on one sound source at a time, trying to feel rather than think about it. Explore the shape, texture and rhythm of each layer before moving on to the next. Continue this cycle until you have taken in every sound within your field of hearing.

## Breaking down the soundscape

- Schafer
  - Sounds of the Earth (for example, whistling wind, creaking glaciers, rumbling volcanoes). - **geophony**
  - Sounds of non-human life (for example, chirping insects, warbling birdsong, howling wolves). - **biophony**
  - Sounds of humanity (for example, clanging industry, babbling voices, beeping machines). - **anthrophony**

Listen to the [Soundscape map](https://www.world-sounds.org/map/)

As we listen lets order the sounds we hear into these three catagories. Keep these concepts in mind as you're working on your sound designs.

# Listening Activity B

Return to the soundscape of your current situation with a more thoughtful ear. Perhaps you can hear rain, wind or other planetary sounds. Are there animals or birds in earshot? How many layers of human sounds are present? Note down everything you can hear across the three soundscape categories.

## Listening and audience

What are the emotions that can be associated with sounds we've heard so far? Or others such as wind, birdsong, or car engines?

It's not necessarily a universal truth that everyone will find the same emotion in the same sounds.

Some sounds are purely informational, and not meant to be emotional.

Sounds that are not heard, but felt, still have a strong impact on us. These are heard through subwoofers that produce only low frequencies.

## Listening Activity C

Choose three elements in your current soundscape. How do the different sounds make you feel, if anything? Note down your responses.

## Advice for working with scripts

{{% note %}}
During the first script reading, try to let the dialogue and action run at real-time pace in your mind, as you breathe in the text. Quickly jot down any sound-related words that your intuition presents, or circle significant moments on the script.

## Listening Activity D

Read the One Last Dance script in Appendix I to test out your intuitive story-listening powers. Allow your imagination to conjure soundscapes as you go, writing down anything that seems to resonate with each scene.

Do not worry if you have limited ideas at this point. Your intuitive powers will grow with experience and we will be looking at different practical approaches in each chapter.
