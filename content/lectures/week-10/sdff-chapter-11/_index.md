What happens when a sound wave travels and hits a surface?

**Echo** is a familiar concept to most; if we shout towards a mountain, or a distant building, we might hear a repetition of the sound, as it bounces off the surface and comes back to us.

**Reverberation**, or ‘reverb’ for short, happens when individual echoes bounce back and forth between surf

**Resonance** is the effect of certain frequencies, or pitches, building up due to reflections that add together, a phenomenon known as wave interference. This happens most obviously in regularly shaped rooms and is one reason why people enjoy singing in the shower – resonance works to enhance the bass of the voice, leading to a fuller sound. It can cause problems in interior dialogue recordings, where certain syllables jump out, as the actor happens to deliver them at the precise pitch that causes the room to resonate.

These elements can either be used to give a scene a sense of realism, or to evocative/emotive effect.

In Citizen Kane’s jigsaw puzzle scene, the protagonist and his wife have a conversation in a large hall of their palatial home. They begin in opposite corners of the room, and their voices reverberate out as they project their words to each other. However, the effect continues just as strongly once they are standing next to each other. In this way, the distance in their relationship is effectively communicated through sound.

Alvin Lucier’s sound piece I Am Sitting In A Room takes an even more unusual approach to worldizing (see Chapter 4). During the performance, a few sentences of text are read into a microphone connected to a recorder. The recording is then played back into thespace, and re-recorded, taking on more of the acoustic properties of the room. This re-recording process is repeated numerous times, until the intelligible words have turned into a droning mush of reverb and resonance – a fingerprint of the room’s acoustics.
