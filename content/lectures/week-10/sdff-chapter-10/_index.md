## Transitions, Rhythm And Time Perception

---

> What is the essence of the director’s work? We could define it as sculpting in time.

> -- Andrei Tarkovsky

One of the most fascinating powers of film is to represent, manipulate and eclipse time. Connecting narrative points through difference and repetition, it is possible to distort the flow of time through a moment, or weave rhythmical patterns into the fabric of a scene. Transitions can be sculpted for dramatic effect, multiple timelines overlaid or time manifested in contrasting ways across sound and image, creating complex effects that take the audience beyond the world of their everyday experience.

## Transitions

- consistent use of sound: sense of continuation
- discontinuity of sound: sense of time passing

{{% note %}}

it is also possible to do the opposite and create a discontinuity of sound on a cut that makes it clear that time has passed. This might be a small change in atmos, to show that the action has moved forward slightly within the same scene, or a larger one implying a more significant passage of time. For example, the introduction of the sound of cicadas can tell the audience that afternoon has become evening; similarly, birdsong may signify a transition from night into morning. Changes in lighting may also provide clear temporal cues, but at other times sound alone needs to carry more of the narrative load.

# flashback/flashforwards

{{% note %}}
Time jumps can also take the form of **flashbacks and flashforwards**, transporting the audience into **parallel narrative threads**, and usually providing some insight into the events of the primary timeline. This might be a memory that adds context to a character’s current state of mind, or a future projection to show the after-effects of a key moment. There are no hard and fast rules for communicating these shifts, and image and sound usually work together to make things clear to the viewer/listener. Production design, colour grading, music and atmos can all help an audience to distinguish between different timelines, with characterful elements often underlining the moment we move from one to the other.

During such transitions, sounds of movement are often used as a **prelap** – a sound edit that comes in ahead of the picture cut. This might be a

- passing train,
- a plane overhead,
- or the lapping waves,
- campfire dances
- and desert convoys

of The English Patient’s numerous backward leaps.

A director can also use a **postlap** with the visual changing to a new scene whilst the sound lingers in the previous one. Let's watch these next clips and decide which ones they use.

Overlapping sound transitions can also be used to create a sense of continuous thread through a montage of different spaces. German thriller movie M famously made early use of this device, also known as a sound bridge, where each transition involves a slow sound dissolve, as we move through different strata of a society responding to the news of an active serial killer. The sound bridges bring a sense of connection, helping to communicate the idea of a city in collective panic over a shared threat.

This video also mentions other uses of sound in M.

Sound also has the power to simultaneously overlay different timelines on top of one other. One commonly used device is a piece of dialogue that returns as a memory, as in the line ‘He’d kill us if he had the chance’, from The Conversation (see Chapter 8).

### Superimpose time - A Touch of Evil

This can be used to great narrative effect, as in the finale of the Orson Welles classic A Touch of Evil, where there is a subversion of the classic film noir ending. Hero Vargas hunts down the corrupt and villainous cop Quinlan with a microphone in place of a gun, as he tries to capture a confession on tape. Once the incriminating words have been recorded, Quinlan is mortally wounded, and as he dies his final words are repeated through the small speaker of the tape recorder.

### Apocolypse Now

Another evocative example comes in Apocalypse Now, during Private Clean’s untimely demise. In this poignant scene, his squad sails along a river from Vietnam to Cambodia, having just received a postal delivery from the USA. Clean is listening to a tape of his mother relaying news from home when their boat is attacked, and he suffers a mortal wound. His mother’s voice, and the loving tone it brings, then continues to run over Clean’s final moments; by overlaying this safe familial mood on to a world of war and death, the sense of tragedy is poetically underlined.

## Time perception - Rhythm and Tempo

{{% note %}}
Composition of sound can clearly be considered in terms of pace, but it can also work as a form of music-like punctuation, adding shape, pause, bracketing or accentuation to the journey of meaning and emotion through a scene. A sound effect at just the right moment might remind the audience of a key story element, draw attention to significant events, or help lift an actor’s delivery where the energy is not quite there. A brief break in the sound, known as a **beat**, can also work to accent the instant that follows.

‘Rhythm is a great tool to play with tension in a scene or to drive it forward,’ sound effects editor Dayo James (Yesterday, Devs) explains. ‘Any time there is an opportunity to play with a rhythmical element it’s always fun – a clock, or waves, heart rate monitors, trains, idling engines, washing machines, a barn door banging open and closed, a dripping tap, a squeaky swing – the world is so full of rhythm. Often the way a scene is cut will imply a rhythm and I will use a rhythmic element to help highlight that.’

Saving Private Ryan, sound effects editor Teresa Eckton describes how she ‘came up with a certain pattern, or rhythm for cutting these machine guns for the background battle, so there was some form’, helping the audience make sense of the chaos.

### Delicatessen

{{% note %}}
This idea of structure through organized sound can also be used as a stylistic device, as it was in Delicatessen’s famously rhythmic scene, which intercuts between the activities of tenants in a dilapidated apartment building, as they move in unison to an ever- accelerating pulse. The sounds of bed springs, paint rollers, and bicycle pumps form repeating rhyming patterns that draw the characters together in a highly satisfying and humorous way.

Phrasing is really apparent in chase scenes and dream sequences. In a chase scene the phrasing in rhythm of the sound effects and music is very fast.

## Irregular rhythms

Making use of these principles, a sound editor might work with unpredictable rhythms and variations in volume to put the audience on edge, speeding up perceived time. Emphasized synchronicity between sound and image can also charge a scene with pace and impact. Both these factors are in play during the dinosaur conflict of Fantasia, which uses Igor Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring as its score. This piece is famous for its rhythmic irregularity, with jagged stabs falling in unpredictable ways, keeping the audience on its toes. This effect is coupled with a picture edit that cuts on the strongest beats, propelling the action forwards.

### To Kill A King

On the other hand, in order to slow the perception of time, regular rhythms and volumes can be used to lull the audience into a sense of certainty. A sparse mix, which under-stimulates the sensory faculties, or the sound of clocks, which combine regularity with a literal reminder of time, will also increase the sense of how long a moment takes. By way of example, the lead-up to a royal execution in To Kill A King is drawn out by the regular striking of a bell, playing over shots of a hushed crowd. Sound and image work together to stretch out the monarch’s final moments. The slowed sense of time creates a contemplative mood, giving the audience a chance to reflect on what has led them to this point.
