# Tracks

## Adding tracks

- Shortcut - cmd + t
- double click in the TCP
- or right click in TCP

## Organization

Make a habit of naming your tracks something to keep them organized. As you name you can move to the next track with the "Tab" key.

To add multiple tracks at once right click and select "insert multiple tracks." We can select the number of tracks and a name for each. See how it will automatically number them for you?

Now color one by right clicking -> Track color. You can also color multiple tracks by selecting them all. Pick colors from a determined palate by going to Options -> Themes -> Theme Adjuster - Custom Colors.

## TCP adjustments

Add a fader to the TCP. Open the theme adjuster and adjust the volume size to get the fader you want.

Double click the fader to adjust the parameter back to the default. This also works for the pan pot.

## Mute / Solo

Muting a track will stop it from playing and save computer resources.

Mute multipe tracks by dragging down after muting one track. Also works for soloing.
