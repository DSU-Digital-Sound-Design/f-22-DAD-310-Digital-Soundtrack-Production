## Cartel Land

Isn't it interesting that documentaries need Foley? Why is that?

She makes the point that a documentary is a film, with a lot of the same concepts and ideas used as in a fictional film. The viewers are still expecting the same sound quality as they're used to in scripted fiction.

- walk footsteps
- spot for props a character is using

The same issues with location sound on scripted sets are magnified with documentary filmmaking. Directors have even less control over their "sets".

Even documentaries have exaggerated sound "Hollywood" or "New York". What is the goal of the documentary?

## Background

She was a classical vocalist. This gave her some really good background in musical timing. She joined a film program and got started work on MOS films that had no sound.

## Process - spotting sessions

Get on after a cut has been made, then watch the film. She'll start planning floor surfaces and shoes. Then look at what special items a a character might be using. A character with a limp?

A Foley editor will then start to cue the film, basically create markers where Foley will be added. This is to plan the session.

She starts the cloth moves first for dialogue!

Then footsteps character by character.

Then props.

The Foley editor will then make sure each cue is recorded then make sure each sound effect is in sync with the shot.

Impressionistic sounds will be used when reality does not match our cinematic expectations. Like for a big clifford dog, she can't go find a large dog, so some creativity needs to be used. She'll use some heavier items to make the footsteps and the Foley mixer will play with pitch shifting to get a correct sound.
